#### Components

* add and refactor the following components and organize them according to the following tree

```text
App
  Provider
    BrowserRouter
      Route / Dashboard
        CategoryForm -- for creating categories
        [CategoryItem] -- list of CategoryItems
           Dropzone
            CategoryForm  -- for updating categories
            ExpenseForm -- for creating expenses
            [ExpenseItem]  -- list of ExpenseItems
              Draggable
                ExpenseForm -- for updating an expense
```

##### Draggable

* Create a component that enables users to drag its children
* It stores data passed into its `dataTransferItem` prop on the event handler for `onDragStart`
  * data should be stored as json under the MIME 'application/json'

##### Droppable

* Create a component that enables users to drop a Draggable component
* onDrop it should invoke a callback with the data passed using the events dataTransferObject
  * remember to parse the json

##### ExpenseItem

* Wrap the contents of the ExpenseItem in a Draggable
* Pass the expense data into the Draggables dataTransferItem prop

###### CategoryItem

* Wrap the contents of a CategoryItem in a dropzone
* When the onComplete of a dropzone is fired update the expense so that it appears on the correct category
